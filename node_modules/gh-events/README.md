# The Grasshopper Event Engine events module

The events module is responsible for creating and managing Grasshopper events.
An event corresponds to a single physical event (lecture, practical, etc.) and can belong to one or more event series and one or more organisation units.
All users are able to subscribe to an event, allowing them to include the event in their personal calendar.
