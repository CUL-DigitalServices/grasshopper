# The Grasshopper Event Engine tenants module

The tenants module is responsible for creating and managing Grasshopper tenants.
Each institution will have its own tenant, containing the list of users for that tenant.
Each tenant can have one or multiple apps, which can be used by the users associated to this tenant.
