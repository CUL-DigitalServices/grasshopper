# The Grasshopper Event Engine series module

The series module is responsible for creating and managing Grasshopper event series.
An event series is a logical unit consisting of multiple individual events and can belong to multiple organisational units.
A user is able to subscribe to an entire event series at once, ensuring that all events in the event series are added to the user's personal calendar.
