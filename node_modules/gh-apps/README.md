# The Grasshopper Event Engine app module

The app module is responsible for creating and managing Grasshopper apps.
Each tenant is able to have one or more associated apps (e.g. Timetable 2013-14, Timetable 2014-15, etc.).
Each app is available through a distinct domain name and has its own associated UI.
