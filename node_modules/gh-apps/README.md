# The Grasshopper Event Engine app module

The app module is responsible for creating and managing Grasshopper apps.
Each app is available through a distinct domain name and has its own associated UI.
An institution is able to have one or more apps (e.g. Timetable 2013-14, Timetable 2014-15, etc.).
