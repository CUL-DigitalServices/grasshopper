# The Grasshopper Event Engine calendar module

The calendar module is responsible for the generation of iCal, RSS and JSON calendar exports.
Calendars can be exported for individual users (based on what the user has subscribed to), series (all events in the series) and organisational units (all events in the organisation unit).
