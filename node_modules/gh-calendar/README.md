# The Grasshopper Event Engine calendar module

The calendar module is responsible for the generation of iCal, RSS and JSON calendar exports.
Calendars can be exported for individual users (based on what the user has subscribed to per app), series (all events in a series) and organisational units (all events in an organisation unit).
